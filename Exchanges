So we must be able to vote to consider which exchange to list our coin first so what we do is to do a voting on it each time we think we have grown enough to list to another exchange.
Starting from small analysis sites like coinmarket caps or coingecko etc to listing to small exchanges and then to bigger ones like coinbase, binance.

This allows to know belif or community too and whether they will support to their fullest i√± decision taken.
